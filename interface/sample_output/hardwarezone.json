  "content": "just wondering if anyone has encountered bosses like this and what they did?\n\ni am in tech, my boss (40+M) is a foreigner. this is his first job here in singapore and hes been working for this company for 3 years. im in a team of 10 ppl, everyone is basically sick of him but doesnt want to speak up (because 5 of then r holding ep and dont wanna go back to their country)\n\ni just started this job, like 3 months in. im not going to be super specific about what happened but basically my team were suppose to come up with a financial report but he told us not to focus on it because a few of the project got halted. so we just went home and suddenly 10pm he started spamming teams \"why is this report not finished!!! i need to present this to cfo tmr!! do you consider my instructions low priority or what?\" and then he quit the chat. but he didnt only quit that chat, he quit every single group chat he has with the team, on teams and whatsapp. idk its my 2nd job only and im kinda dumbfounded... my previous supervisor in my 1st job was great and i really regret leaving my previous company for like 20% pay bump \n\nsome other things my current supervisor has said:\n- (fyi we wfh fridays company policy) he doesnt like it if we wfh fridays, and gets sarcastic whenever someone mc on monday because its a \"4 day holiday\" for them (fri, sat, sun, mon)\n- rejected a team member's leave because it was after his reservist (he was also super unhappy he went to reservist)\n- i feel like i can elaborate more but im afraid of getting found out... \n\nya anyway anyone has experience with this? im just 2 years into the working world and 3 months into my 2nd job... was thinking of telling hr about it because im going to resign soon because hes the reason why im ending my probation. company is good, office has nice environment and my team members are great but my boss is really... idk how to even describe sia lol",

Hey it's a company that needs work done. Already gone on reservist and away then still want to take more time off? Holiday resort is it?\nI dunno but it sounds like all your team members are more the slacker kind. No motivation. No ambition. Not driven.  Thinking more of WFH and leave.\nI am strongly against WFH as I believe it is shake leg at home do no work and is a holiday for staff pretty much. WFH is GARBAGE \n\n\n\n\n This is just an inkling of what the real world is. I dunno what your first job was but you're going to realize this is the norm.\n\nIt's highly competitive. Want to get ahead got to do more not less. \nTo earn extraordinary income you need to be extraordinary. Make sense? \nSee problems as challenges and opportunity.\nBecome the go to guy that fixes problems. Rescues last minute rush jobs and jobs going to miss the deadline. Be the CLUTCH team member. Machiam like Michael Jordan Kobe Bryant Cristiano Ronaldo the one they turn to when the team need to pull off a result.\n\nWhy not have that mentality? After all its the work and tasks that matter. Why focus on boss reactions and behavior? If he ask nicely would it be better? Maybe but maybe not. \n\nFocus on what you can do. Not what someone else is behaving. \n\nThat's my advice to you.",

We are no longer like in the 1960s and 1970s got pension. People stay at company for 30 years kind. So why you so hung up how the company treat people? Don't let it affect you. Ask yourself those he treat badly are they pulling their weight fully or not? Always got reasons one. \n\n\n\n\n\nWhy upset? These days roles change. Software engineer is going to be sunset industry with AI now. It already is. Vendor management you deal with people at least there's still a role there for you. Might have better prospects. Also good to have diversity of experience. Especially when you are starting out. Look at the positives. \n\n\n\n\nAfter 3 months quit and find another job? Won't look good on your CV for sure from what I have heard in Singapore.\nBut hey if you can find another better paying job I say go for it. Pay rise is always good.",

Even more so if work is piling up.\n\nYoung man, the unhappiness you have with the boss is not the worse of the worst. Wait till you encounter one who throws you under the bus or plays favouritism to break up the team. Or pretend to be nice to you but behind your back, speaks ill of you. I don't find your situation that dire. Who knows, your next boss may be even worse than this one. Those who quit in your team are Singaporeans? I am very sure they have father and mother ATM that's why can quit at the slightest unhappiness.\n\nLearn how to handle your boss and you will find your work easier!",
